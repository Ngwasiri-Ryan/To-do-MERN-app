## Todo MERN App

A Todo MERN application is a to-do list web app built using the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB (database), Express.js (backend framework), React.js (frontend framework), and Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment).

This Todo app allows users to manage their tasks: adding new ones, marking them complete, and potentially editing or deleting existing tasks. It's a great way to practice building a full-stack application using MERN technologies.
